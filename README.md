Redditpaper is an OS X app that downloads images from the subreddits /r/wallpapers and /r/wallpaper. It automatically displays them on your desktop and provides options to change periodically, cycle through in order or randomly, skip NSFW submissions, or filter by size.

It doesn't run in your dock, but has a 'rectangle' icon in the status bar.
