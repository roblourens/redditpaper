Internet connection management strategy

* Avoid fancy caching strategies- assume that when the computer is offline, it's the user's problem.
* Never change the wallpaper to the default blue screen
x When the computer is offline, the previously downloaded wallpapers can be used, BUT ONLY if the computer was
  online when the program was launched (so listings have been downloaded)
	1. Maintain a separate list of the saved listings. Switch to it when internet connection is lost
		* Could be saved for when app launches with no connection (not really important)
		* Or just add a key/value to the existing set of listings
	2. If an image can't be downloaded, move to the next one
		* More extendable to images that timeout?
	3. Load some images in the background
		* Faster switching
* Assume the app only needs to be useful online. When offline, disable next/previous buttons. If timer ends
  while offline, update when next online


General data
* Maintain the current index, even when a new set of data is downloaded
  * justification: for example, imagine if the set of listings was updated continuously. It wouldn't make
    any sense to keep resetting the user's viewed index.
  * This may lead to some weirdness, such as the user clicking next and getting the same image.


File management strategy

* Save files in Library when they are requested
* When a new set of listings are loaded, delete all previously downloaded wallpapers from the Library


Error strategy

* Log all errors for debugging
* Display an error message only when absolutely necessary


Status bar menu strategy

* Next, previous, save, etc. refer to the last wallpaper set by redditpaper during this run. If redditpaper
  has not set a wallpaper during this run, the buttons are disabled.
